<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>General Policy</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">GETNORD TECHNOLOGIES has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. GETNORD TECHNOLOGIES does not sell, rent, or otherwise distribute individual user information to outside parties. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.getnord.com </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your privacy is important, so we'd like to explain what information we collect when you visit getnord.com, why we collect it and how it is used. We'd also like to explain your options to access and control your information, our data security practices and other matters. This Policy is governed by our Terms of Service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Your Consent To This Policy</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms of Service take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version on our Site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Special Note About Children</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Site is not intended for children, especially kids under 13. Children may use this Site only with the direct supervision of their parent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>What Information Do We Collect From You and Why?</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we collect personal information, you may later access and modify it, but you may not remove it from our system yourself. You may choose simply not to provide personal contact information by opting-out at the point of collection.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Certain Exceptional Disclosures</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Information About 'Cookies' &amp; Why We Use Them</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We mostly use "session cookies" that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can't be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>How We Protect Information We Collect</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Length of Time We Keep Information</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Legal Disclaimer </strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This Policy is governed by Oregon law, excluding conflicts of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in Oregon within one year after the claim arose, or be barred.</span></p>
